# Introduction

This repository is created for the mini data analysis project of STAT 545A. In this project, we practice manipulating, summarizing, and visualizing data in tibbles using `dplyr` and `ggplot`.

Anyone can explore the project by downloading the mini-project_mini-project-1.Rmd file and play with the code chunks in Rstudio. Or you can just view the project by taking a look at the mini-project_mini-project-1.md file.
