# Introduction

This repository is created for the mini data analysis project of STAT 545A. 

In Milestone 1, we practice manipulating, summarizing, and visualizing data in tibbles using `dplyr` and `ggplot`.

Anyone can explore Milestone 1 by going to the `Milestone 1` folder and downloading the *mini-project_mini-project-1.Rmd* and play with the code chunks in Rstudio. Or you can just view the project by taking a look at the *mini-project_mini-project-1.md* file.

In Milestone 2, we finish up the mini data analysis project by going deeper into each research question.

Anyone can explore Milestone 2 by going to the `Milestone 2` folder by downloading the *mini-project-2.Rmd* file. Or you can just view the report by taking a look at the *mini-project-2.md* file.

The `output` folder contains the output dataset and model object from Milestone 2.
